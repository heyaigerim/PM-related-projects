## 📌 **Milestone 1: Data Processing & Chunking**  

### 🎯 **Objective**  
Enable AI-powered retrieval by **processing and structuring text data** for machine learning models.  

### ❌ **Problem Statement**  
Most search engines and chatbots **struggle with retrieving relevant, contextually accurate information** from large text corpora. Poorly structured text leads to **fragmented search results**, reducing user experience and efficiency.  

### ✅ **Solution Implemented**  
1️⃣ **Text Preprocessing & Cleaning**  
- Extracted and processed **five AI-related documents** into structured text.  
- Removed noise, redundant spaces, and ensured high-quality input data.  

2️⃣ **Intelligent Text Chunking**  
- **Fixed-size chunking:** Managed **500-character segments** without breaking sentences.  
- **Semantic chunking:** Grouped logically related paragraphs using **NLP similarity techniques**.  

3️⃣ **Output for AI Retrieval**  
- Stored structured text chunks in a **Pickle file (chunks.pkl)** for efficient retrieval.  

### 🏆 **Product Thinking & Challenges**  
✔ **Scalability:** How can AI handle large-scale unstructured data for search?  
✔ **Usability:** Does chunking preserve enough context for meaningful retrieval?  
✔ **Iteration & Testing:** Adjusted chunk sizes and models to optimize for accuracy.

## 📌 **Milestone 2: AI-Powered Retrieval & Embeddings**  

### 🎯 **Objective**  
Transform structured text into **AI-searchable knowledge** using **vector embeddings**.  

### ❌ **Problem Statement**  
Keyword-based search engines fail to understand **context**, leading to **irrelevant or incomplete results**. To improve retrieval quality, **machine learning embeddings** must replace traditional keyword matching.  

### ✅ **Solution Implemented**  
1️⃣ **Embedding Generation**  
- Used **sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)** to convert text chunks into **numerical embeddings**.  
- Stored embeddings efficiently for **scalable AI-based search**.  

2️⃣ **Vector Database Creation**  
- Stored embeddings in a **Python dictionary**, where embeddings act as **keys for chunk retrieval**.  
- Ensured **efficient hashable storage** for quick access.  

3️⃣ **Cosine Similarity-Based Search**  
- Implemented **semantic search retrieval** using **cosine similarity**.  
- Users input queries, and the system returns the **most relevant text** using **vector comparisons**.  

4️⃣ **Optimizations & Refinements**  
- **Increased chunk size** and applied **semantic filtering** for better query accuracy.  
- Set a **minimum similarity threshold (0.6)** to eliminate weak matches.  

### 🏆 **Product Thinking & Challenges**  
✔ **Relevance & Ranking:** How do we prioritize the most useful results for users?  
✔ **Performance Optimization:** Reducing search latency with efficient embedding storage.  
✔ **Iterative Testing:** Refining **similarity scoring** & chunking strategy based on query performance.
