## Stateless Flask Server | Command Parsing | APIs & Data Processing  

---

## Overview  
This project is a **stateless Flask-based chatbot server** that parses user messages and processes commands in a structured format. It connects with a Terminal-based chat interface (**TerminalChat**), handling various user inputs and returning formatted responses.

---

## Why Itâ€™s Interesting:
- **Problem-Solving Approach:** Demonstrates user interaction handling & structured command processing.  
- **Technical Understanding:** API-driven chat experience, message parsing, and structured response handling.  
- **End-to-End Execution:** Covers architecture, API design, and integration with an existing chat interface.

---

## Why This Project Matters for Product Management  
- **User-Centered Thinking:** Builds structured chat interactions based on user intent.  
- **API-Driven Workflow:** Demonstrates knowledge of backend communication & product APIs.  
- **Scalability Considerations:** Stateless architecture allows easy deployment & scaling.  
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Could extend into AI/NLP-based interactions.

---

## Key Features  
### 1. Stateless Flask API  
- Receives user messages via **POST /chat**.  
- Parses messages based on command structure.  
- Returns structured **JSON responses**.

### 2. Natural Command Processing  
- Commands start with **/** and extract keywords for task execution.  
- General messages return a default response.

#### **Example:**  
##### **User Input:**  
```json
{
  "chat": "/remind me to submit my application"
}
```
##### **Response:**  
```json
{
  "chat": "remind: me to submit my application"
}
```

### 3. Integration with TerminalChat  
- Terminal-based chat system (**terminal_chatbot.py**).  
- API-driven real-time interaction.

### 4. Runs on Custom Port (5003)  
- Flexible port configuration for deployment.

---

## Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Flask** (API framework)  
- **TerminalChat** (Client interface)  
- **Git & GitHub** (Version control & collaboration)

## Getting Started  

### 1.Clone the Repository  
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/heyaigerim/my-projects/tree/main/Stateless%20Flask%20Server
$ cd chatbot-server
```

### 2. Set Up the Chat Server  
```bash
$ cd terminal-chat/chat_server
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install Flask
```

### 3.Run the Flask Server  
```bash
$ python server.py
```
**Expected Output:**  
```
Running on http://127.0.0.1:5003/
```

### 4. Run the Chat Client  
- In a new terminal window:  
```bash
$ cd terminal-chat
$ python3 terminal_chatbot.py http://localhost:5003
```
**TerminalChat will now interact with your Flask API!**

---

## Testing Commands  
| **User Input** | **Expected Output** |
|---------------|------------------|
| `/remind me to submit my resume` | `remind: me to submit my resume` |
| `/start` | `start:` |
| `Hello, how are you?` | `None: Hello, how are you?` |
| `/notify user about the deadline` | `notify: user about the deadline` |

---

## Future Enhancements  
- **Integrate with LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) for smart response suggestions.**  
- **Deploy API as a microservice (AWS, GCP, etc.).**  
- **Expand to a web-based UI for real-time interaction.**
