# üçΩÔ∏è Faceted Image Search: Food Photography Collection
INFO 202: Information Organization and Retrieval 
UC Berkeley, 2024

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of **faceted search and metadata design** in a food photography collection. The system enables users to intuitively browse and search for food images categorized by meal type, cuisine, and dietary preference using **Algolia's faceted search**.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create a structured **image search experience** optimized for food lovers, bloggers, chefs, and marketers. By implementing a **hierarchical faceted classification**, users can explore food images with multiple levels of categorization.

üéØ Why This Matters for Product Management
This project showcases my ability to:

Design user-friendly search experiences using metadata and taxonomy.
Structure large datasets into logical hierarchies for better UX.
Work with Algolia and JSON data for scalable search solutions.
Apply product thinking by optimizing navigation for target users.

## Features

 **Faceted Search**: Users can navigate images using structured facets such as:
   - **Meal Type**: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner  

**Hierarchical Metadata**: Three-level categorization for refined search results.  

**JSON Metadata Format**: Organized dataset for easy scalability and search integration.  

**Algolia Integration**: Hosted search interface powered by Algolia for fast, user-friendly searching.
