Goal & Theme
As a food enthusiast, I wanted to build an interface that helps others discover exciting new dishes.
My focus was on visually appealing meals, ensuring the images are both enticing and high-quality.
The collection showcases a wide range of foods for various occasions and mealtimes, making it easy for everyone to find a relevant meal.
This collection is also ideal for food writers and stock image seekers, providing a curated selection of high-quality food photography.

Faceted Category Choice & Structure
To help users explore new dishes, I structured the categories around natural meal contexts.

Meal-Based Categorization
- People often associate foods with specific mealtimes.
- Breakfast, lunch, and dinner serve as top-level categories, aligning with the way users typically search for meals.

Taste & Experience-Based Categorization
To enhance engagement, subcategories reflect taste, feel, and purpose:
- Light meals vs. hearty dishes
- Sweet breakfasts vs. savory breakfasts
- Comfort foods for nostalgic cravings

Specific Meal Item Categorization
For users refining their choices, the final level includes specific meal items such as:
- Pancakes
- Waffles
- Ramen

This structure mirrors the natural food discovery processâ€”users start broad and refine their search based on cravings and taste preferences.

For example, a user browsing the collection might see an appetizing pancake image and realize they've been craving pancakes. This level of categorization allows them to view all pancake options at once.

Final Thoughts
This categorization system reflects the way people naturally explore new foods.

With intuitive meal-based filtering, sensory-driven classifications, and detailed item categories, this search experience makes finding the perfect dish effortless and enjoyable.

Whether you're a food lover, blogger, chef, or content creator, this faceted image search will help you discover your next delicious inspiration.
