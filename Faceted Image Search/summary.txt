To help fellow food lovers explore **new dishes**, I structured my categories around **natural meal contexts**.

- People naturally associate foods with **specific mealtimes**.  
- **Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner** serve as top-level categories, aligning with the way users typically search for meals.  

### **2️⃣ Taste & Experience-Based Categorization**  
- To enhance engagement, I introduced **subcategories** reflecting taste, feel, and purpose:  
  - **Light Meals** vs. **Hearty Dishes**  
  - **Sweet Breakfasts** vs. **Savory Breakfasts**  
  - **Comfort Foods** for warm, nostalgic cravings  

### **3️⃣ Specific Meal Item Categorization**  
- For users refining their choices, the final level includes **specific meal items** such as:  
  - 🥞 **Pancakes**  
  - 🧇 **Waffles**  
  - 🍜 **Ramen**  
  
This structure **mirrors the natural food discovery process**—users start broad, then refine based on **personal cravings and taste preferences**.  

For example, a foodie browsing the collection might **see an appetizing pancake image** and suddenly realize they've been craving pancakes all along! This level of categorization lets them **view all pancake options at once**.
